# Topolog

Topolog is a tool designed for checking topological errors in vector data.

## Available Use Cases

1. **Check Overlapping Features:** Identify any instances where features overlap within the vector data.
   
2. **Check Containment Features:** Detect any containment issues where one feature is completely contained within another.

3. **Check Gaps in Features:** Highlight any gaps or spaces within features that should be contiguous.

For now, the script is still not capable of handling or fixing any topological errors. However, it is sufficient for identifying topological errors in multiple files simultaneously.
